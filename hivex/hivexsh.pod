hivexsh - Windows Registry hive shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 hivexsh [-options] [hivefile]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program provides a simple shell for navigating Windows Registry
'hive' files.  It uses the hivex library for access to these binary
files.

Firstly you will need to provide a hive file from a Windows operating
system.  The hive files are usually located in
C<C:\Windows\System32\Config> and have names like C<software>,
C<system> etc (without any file extension).  For more information
about hive files, read L<hivex(3)>.  For information about downloading
files from virtual machines, read L<virt-cat(1)> and L<guestfish(1)>.

You can provide the name of the hive file to examine on the command
line.  For example:

 hivexsh software

Or you can start C<hivexsh> without any arguments, and immediately use
the C<load> command to load a hive:

 $ hivexsh
 
 Welcome to hivexsh, the hivex interactive shell for examining
 Windows Registry binary hive files.
 
 Type: 'help' for help with commands
       'quit' to quit the shell
 
 > load software
 software\>

Navigate through the hive's keys using the C<cd> command, as if it
contained a filesystem, and use C<ls> to list the subkeys of the
current key.  Other commands are listed below.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d>

Enable lots of debug messages.  If you find a Registry file that this
program cannot parse, please enable this option and post the complete
output I<and> the Registry hive file in your bug report.

=item B<-f> filename

Read commands from C<filename> instead of stdin.  To write a hivexsh
script, use:

 #!/usr/bin/hivexsh -f

=back

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<cd> path

Change to the subkey C<path>.  Use Windows-style backslashes to
separate path elements, and start with a backslash in order to start
from the root of the hive.  For example:

 cd \Classes\*

moves from the root node, to the C<Classes> node, to the C<*> node.
If you were already at the root node, you could do this instead:

 cd Classes\*

or even:

 cd Classes
 cd *

Path elements (node names) are matched case insensitively, and
characters like space, C<*>, and C<?> have I<no> special significance.

C<..> may be used to go to the parent directory.

=item B<close> | B<unload>

Close the currently loaded hive.

=item B<exit> | B<quit>

Exit the shell.

=item B<load> hivefile

Load the binary hive named C<hivefile>.  The currently loaded hive, if
any, is closed.  The current directory is changed back to the root
node.

=item B<ls>

List the subkeys of the current hive Registry key.  Note this command
does not take any arguments.

=item B<lsval> [key]

List the (key, value) pairs of the current hive Registry key.  If no
argument is given then all pairs are displayed.  If C<key> is given,
then the value of the named key is displayed.  If C<@> is given, then
the value of the default key is displayed.
