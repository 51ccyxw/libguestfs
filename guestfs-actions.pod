=head2 guestfs_mount

 int guestfs_mount (guestfs_h *handle,
		const char *device,
		const char *mountpoint);

Mount a guest disk at a position in the filesystem.  Block devices
are named C</dev/sda>, C</dev/sdb> and so on, as they were added to
the guest.  If those block devices contain partitions, they will have
the usual names (eg. C</dev/sda1>).  Also LVM C</dev/VG/LV>-style
names can be used.

The rules are the same as for L<mount(2)>:  A filesystem must
first be mounted on C</> before others can be mounted.  Other
filesystems can only be mounted on directories which already
exist.

This function return 0 on success or -1 on error.

=head2 guestfs_sync

 int guestfs_sync (guestfs_h *handle);

This syncs the disk, so that any writes are flushed through to the
underlying disk image.

You should always call this if you have modified a disk image, before
calling C<guestfs_close>.

This function return 0 on success or -1 on error.

=head2 guestfs_touch

 int guestfs_touch (guestfs_h *handle,
		const char *path);

Touch acts like the L<touch(1)> command.  It can be used to
update the filesystems on a file, or, if the file does not exist,
to create a new zero-length file.

This function return 0 on success or -1 on error.
