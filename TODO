/tmp/libguestfs temporary directory is not cleaned up.

We badly need to actually implement the FTP server mentioned in the
documentation.

(From JÃ¡n ONDREJ (SAL))

We should provide a way to stream partitions in and out.

Thus:

dd-out /dev/sda1 > [some file]

dd-in /dev/sda1 < [some file]

Along with this, we need to be able to call the resize2fs program to
resize the filesystem in case it is larger or smaller than the target
partition.

Another useful feature would be to allow rsync to/from a stream for
whole filesystems and subdirectories.

The current protocol is message-oriented and doesn't support
streaming.  But it's simple enough that we could add this.
