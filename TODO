We badly need to actually implement the FTP server mentioned in the
documentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BufferIn and BufferOut should turn into <char *, int> and simple
strings in other languages that can handle 8 bit clean strings.
Limit on transfers would still be 2MB for these types.
 - then implement write-file properly
 - and implement read-file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Augeas support should be completely optional.  Major platforms lack
it, such as RHEL 5.
