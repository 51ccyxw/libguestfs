We badly need to actually implement the FTP server mentioned in the
documentation.

Or: Implement a FUSE-based filesystem.  See the FUSE mountlo
project which does something similar, albeit only to single
filesystems:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BufferIn and BufferOut should turn into <char *, int> and simple
strings in other languages that can handle 8 bit clean strings.
Limit on transfers would still be 2MB for these types.
 - then implement write-file properly
 - and implement read-file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement febootstrap command.
