PLEASE LOOK AT THE TOP OF EACH FILE BEFORE EDITING TO SEE WHETHER IT
IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED OR NOT.

Adding a new action
----------------------------------------------------------------------

All action functions are generated automatically, so there are only
two files you need to edit:

(1) src/generator.ml: Add your new action, parameters, description,
etc. to the big list called 'functions' at the top of this file.

(2) Edit/create a C file in daemon/ subdirectory which implements your
'do_action' function.  Take a look at one of the numerous examples
there.

You will need to run src/generator.ml (from the top directory) which
regenerates all the auto-generated files, and then continue with the
ordinary build process.

Formatting
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Try to use GNU / Emacs default formatting, following the convention
used elsewhere in the source.

Please make sure that the code compiles without warnings.

Please test any changes.

Directories
----------------------------------------------------------------------

daemon/
	The daemon that runs inside the guest and carries out actions.

examples/
	The examples.

fish/
	Guestfish (the command-line program / shell)

images/
	Some guest images to test against.  These are gzipped to save
	space.  You have to unzip them before use.

	Also contains some files used by the test suite.

java/
	Java bindings.

m4/
	M4 macros used by autoconf.

ocaml/
	OCaml bindings.

perl/
	Perl bindings.

python/
	Python bindings.

ruby/
	Ruby bindings.

src/
	Source code to the C library.
	Also contains the crucial generator program.

Debugging
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a good idea to use guestfish to try out new commands.

Debugging the daemon is a problem because it runs inside a minimal
qemu environment.  However you can print messages from the daemon, and
they will show up if you use 'guestfish -v'.
