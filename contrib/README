Random contributions and things which don't fit in anywhere else
----------------------------------------------------------------------

autobuild/
        The autobuild script that we use to build and test the
        tarballs on Debian and elsewhere.

guestfsd-in-wine.sh
        Run a Windows-compiled guestfsd under Wine.  Read the
        instructions at the top of this file carefully.

intro/ "Slides" for an intro to libguestfs.  This is a short (10-15
        min) talk that I give to introduce the main features of
        libguestfs.  The slides are in the form of a complete
        self-contained HTML page with a handful images that can be
        easily distributed before the talk.

visualize-alignment/
        Tests for visualizing block device reads and writes and
        alignment using a patched qemu.  See the README file in that
        directory.
