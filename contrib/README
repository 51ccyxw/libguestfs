        from EL-5 here:
        http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/libguestfs/EL-5/

dependency-diagram/
        A "dot" file (for graphviz) which describes the dependencies
        between the many different components of the libguestfs

        into the code.

        An experimental, non-working attempt to use febootstrap
        to install operating systems.

        [REMOVED]

        from Fedora instead:
        http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/libguestfs/devel/
