[guestfish] Built-in commands like 'alloc' and 'help' don't auto-complete.

[libguestfs] /tmp/libguestfs temporary directory is not cleaned up
(sometimes).

[kernel?] Kernel boot times are significantly slower for Fedora 11/12
than for Fedora 10, like 2-3 times slower.  This greatly affects the
time it takes to launch the subprocess (although it does still work).
