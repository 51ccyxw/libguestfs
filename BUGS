[guestfish] Built-in commands like 'alloc' and 'help' don't auto-complete.

[libguestfs] /tmp/libguestfs temporary directory is not cleaned up
(sometimes).

[libguestfs] qemu process not cleaned up occasionally.  This appears
to happen only if the main program or library segfaults, in which case
the atexit handler which would normally perform cleanup is not run.

[kernel?] Kernel boot times are significantly slower for Fedora 11/12
than for Fedora 10, like 2-3 times slower.  This greatly affects the
time it takes to launch the subprocess (although it does still work).

[java] Java bindings documentation messed up.  See:
