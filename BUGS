[guestfish] Built-in commands like 'alloc' and 'help' don't auto-complete.

[libguestfs] /tmp/libguestfs temporary directory is not cleaned up
sometimes.  This appears to happen (only?) if the main program
segfaults.

[libguestfs] qemu process not cleaned up occasionally.  This appears
to happen only if the main program or library segfaults, in which case
the atexit handler which would normally perform cleanup is not run.
sometimes.  This appears to happen (only?) if the main program
segfaults.
[testing a hacky fix to this]

[kernel?] Kernel boot times are significantly slower for Fedora 11/12
than for Fedora 10, like 2-3 times slower.  This greatly affects the
time it takes to launch the subprocess (although it does still work).
[fixed - was a KVM bug]

[java] Java bindings documentation messed up.  See:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/

[libguestfs] If qemu process is a shell script, then it is not cleaned
up correctly, even on "good" exit.  This is because we need to set up
a new process group (see commented code for doing setpgid).
[fixed? - added documentation in the manual page that you have to
do 'exec qemu' in the wrapper.  However I still notice that the
recovery process kills qemu, instead of it being killed by the
parent process, or at least that's what I think is happening]

[libguestfs] Some occasional data corruption, certainly on tgz-out.
Try using tgz-out on a very large directory.
[we think this is fixed by 64a6a828bd318622420cf3018899392fd80c14e7]
